# waitlist-bot-script
This is a script I wrote with Python, Discord.py, and Selenium to check a few different UBC courses (hope that's allowed - oops). I thought it would be beneficial to post on Github in case you're looking for a quick polling-style web bot!

You can replace the link and selector with pretty much anything - I would also obviously recommend hosting on a server like AWS for constant running, but it doesn't work terribly just running on my computer terminal. 

Happy scraping :)
